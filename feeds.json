Feeds are a way for you to make announcements and ping a specific role without having to deal with the annoyances and potential abuse from having a mentionable role or manually toggling a role inbetween mentionable and not. You need Manage Server Discord permissions to use the feed commands.\n\nA feed is an association between a role and a channel. When you use the feed announce command, the role will be set to mentionable very briefly, the role will be pinged and your message will be sent in the channel with which the feed is associated, and the role will subsequently be set back to unmentionable.",
